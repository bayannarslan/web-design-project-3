 <h2 id = "review">My Review:</h2>
 <p>Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies because of how unique 
    the storyline is and how beautifully drawn and animated it is. The
    movie has so many details in the background, like Miyazaki's other
    works, and it feels like it is drawn with so much attention. 
    Spirited Away is such a visually stunning film filled with some 
    of the most imaginative characters I've ever seen. In addition 
    to the visuals, the music is beautiful, and the story has something 
    for audience members of all ages.
